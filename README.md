### Why

I wanted something simple without needing the ruby-bindings.
At the same time I wanted some 'notmuch'-presets (which can be defined in the script) which I could launch with the arrow-up keys.

### Remote usage

My email gets fetched and tagged on my homeserver.
However, on my local laptops I use a simple remote bashwrapper for the `notmuch` binary, you can do this like so:

    wget "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/coderofsalvation/c60a1cde22d972828d4c/raw/a04ac4e82468d024e5865444292417e4555fd3f3/remotewrapper.bash" -O notmuch
    sed -i 's/cmd=asciidoc/cmd=notmuch/g' notmuch
    (open the notmuch file in an editor and change the host/ip e.g.)
    cp notmuch ~/bin/notmuch
    
Now you can run 'notmuch-bash' and 'notmuch' on your laptop (while it actually executes at the homeserver).
 
### Known Issues

* 'show' does not display message which are multipart-messages
